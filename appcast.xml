			<title>1.26.248</title>
			<description>## Current Release Notes
* Added a workaround for Paradox’s brilliant new "Case Sensitivity on a Case-Insensitive Filesystem" feature. Turns out the game picks one mod path (seemingly at random, but probably the first with the lowest casing), then does strict case-sensitive string comparison against it… on Windows… where paths aren’t case-sensitive. Because who needs consistency, right? Irony now force-normalizes paths to avoid this latest episode of Paradox QA Theater.

## Release Notes 1.26
* Update dependencies
* Bump to net8 which should grant some performance improvements (win7 might not work going forward)
* Remove ripple animation from Material themes (per #484)
* Irony is now single instance app
* Disable OSX update installation (online check only now)
* Added new diff viewer
* Stellaris 3.11 beta compatibility
* Added conflict solver option to skip parsing some languages
* Add conflict solver configuration to customize colors for new diff viewer
* Add templateable merge mod naming</description>
