# Irony Mod Manager

Irony Mod Manager is a powerful, high-performance and fully moddable alternative to the official Paradox launchers.  
Originally built for Stellaris, it now supports multiple Clausewitz and Jomini engine games with deep integration and mod conflict awareness.

Irony understands game structures, FIOS/LIOS rules, and provides deterministic load order management — enabling a professional modding workflow for both new and advanced users.
